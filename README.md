# **üß† NeuraMorphosis Chat**
This is **NeuraMorphosis Chat**. It is a improved version over the previous **Morph Chat** which features:
   - **Major UI Overhaul** - The entire sites' ui is completly revamped, with a more distinct dark purple theme which will now be used across all NeuraMorphosis products from now on.
   - **Enchanced user-friendliness** - The new version has a settings menu with many models to choose from and also allows the user to control the theme, and the amount of thinking the model should do before responding.
   - **Advanced Models** - This chat app has support for multiple high quality models, they are sorted from:
        - **Speed**
        - **Performance**
        - **Multimodality**
        - **Cost-efficiency**   
<br>
 This means that this chat platorm is an excellent all rounder for everybody needs, as there are people who would want a fast AI that isnt as smart or maybe an AI that takes its' time to craft or solve a complex piece of writing, code, or solution to a problem.'
